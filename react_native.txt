If getting build errors:
Had to check and then specify ruby versions with rbenv and chose local version
Then installed cocoapods with ruby
Then I went into ios/
Then pod install
Maybe this wouldve been avoided if I did npm install 

2 axes: main axis and cross axis; cross axis is perpendicular to main
 
Row: main axis is left to right
Column: top to bottom
Row reverse: right to left
Column reverse: bottom to top
 
justifyContent: for organizing along main axis
alignItems: for organizing along cross axis; default is stretch
 
Defining how much space containers and items should take:
You define how much they should take along the cross axis using align items in the parent container
 
You can tell a child item how much it should take of what it can get along the main axis using flex
 
Flex property is assigned to items within the container
Flex: 1 => takes all that it can take while allowing the remaining elements to exist along main axis
